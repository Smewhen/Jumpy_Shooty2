Based on the B3agz minecraft in unity tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h66IN1Pndd0&list=PLVsTSlfj0qsWEJ-5eMtXsYp03Y9yF1dEn

With additional pieces added with the intention of prototyping a competetive minecraft-like game similar to infini-miner, with a space/ asteroid mining theme
--Player movement should be bouncy/ jetpack assist
--Base building: mining units, respawn points, equipment depots, defensive turrets, drone factories, bunkers, etc
----Blue-print system for quicker construction?
--Main goal is to eliminate enemy team and/or extract X amount of some resource
--World map should be spherical, maybe look into 3 sided cylinder solution?
